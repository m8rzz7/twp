	<p>
		We all know trash. We all have trash. It's something that we are <em>very</em> familiar with trash, but most do not know much about it. Each day, we unthinkingly throw away an innumerable amount of mundane items that have served their purpose and outlived their usefulness. It might seem clichéd to say so, but one man’s trash is another man’s treasure. Every single one of these seemingly insignificant items has a unique story. When we discard an item, we do not cease its story. Rather, we are concluding the chapter of its story that involves us, the person who chose to discard it.
	</p>
	<p>
		As part of this ongoing endeavor, my project draws on the insights of various experts in the field, including but not limited to <a href="https://fallowmedia.com/2016/feb/waste/" target="_blank">Brian Thill</a>, who provides a profound understanding of how trash is a marker of our everyday lives, and <a href="https://anthropology.uchicago.edu/directory/Sarah-Newman" target="_blank">Sarah Newman</a>, an archeologist who examines human relationships with trash. Other influential figures, such as <a href="https://bogost.com/writing/blog/exploded_ontography/" target="_blank">Ian Bogost</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/06/special-series/vik-muniz-brazil-garbage-art.html" target="_blank">Vik Muniz</a>, and <a href="https://www.suspended-objects.org/" target="_blank">Jenny Odell</a>, have also greatly informed my perspective and approach to <em>Trash of the Week</em>. Their work, which ranges from the philosophical musings on the nature of waste to the critical analysis of its societal implications, offers a comprehensive and insightful framework that guides my project.

			In the book <em>Waste: Object Lessons</em>, Brian Thill profoundly stated, <q>Trash is the marker of our everyday lives, the residue of our every action</q> (Thill, 2015, p. 17). This particular quote echoes the fundamental ethos of <em>Trash of the Week</em>, a project that strives to underline the often-overlooked stories that are inherently attached to the objects we routinely discard. Not only that, but it also aims to shed light on the ramifications of our consumption habits and how they contribute to the ever-growing mounds of waste. As Thill so eloquently articulates, our trash truly serves as a reflection of our daily lives and actions. It is the tangible evidence of our existence and carries the weight of our choices and decisions. Consequently, it becomes a powerful symbol, not just of our individual identities but also of our collective identity as a society. It serves as a stark reminder of our impact on the world and the legacy we leave behind.

		Sarah Newman–an archaeologist and assistant professor at the University of Chicago–affirms this belief about trash as well. In an <a href="https://news.uchicago.edu/story/archaeologist-talks-trash" target="_blank">interview</a> with <a href="https://news.uchicago.edu/taxonomy/term/58415" target="_blank">Tori Lee</a>, Newman explained that when teaching about trash and its relation to archeology, she references Gregg Segal’s series of photographs called <a href="https://www.lensculture.com/articles/gregg-segal-7-days-of-garbage" target="_blank"><q>7 Days of Garbage.</q></a> She used this series of pictures to illustrate how someone’s <q>trash</q> can reveal a lot about them, such as <q>details about family composition, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, gender roles, tastes, and hobbies, etc.</q> (Newman, as quoted in Lee, 2023). Additionally, as an archeologist, Newman notes that what people consider <q>trash</q> has changed throughout human history, and human relationships with waste vary culturally. <em>Trash of the Week</em> intentionally resembles Segal’s <q>7 Days of Garbage</q> photographic series and gives more insight into the <q>trash</q> through the writing.

	<h2 id="goal">Mission and Ethos</h2>
	
	<p>
		The central aim of <em>Trash of the Week</em> is to reflect and emulate the observed actions and methods of how others have embarked on their unique journeys of documenting trash. The significance of this endeavor lies in its potential to underscore and shed light on the staggering amount of waste we, as a society, collectively generate on a weekly basis. <em>Trash of the Week</em> is not a project dedicated to merely pointing out the problem but rather fostering consciousness and mindfulness about our consumption and disposal habits. This weekly practice, a commitment in itself, has been inspired and influenced by the similar mindful practices, dedicated efforts, and environmental consciousness of others who have embarked on comparable projects. Through their actions, these individuals have set an example and paved the way for such initiatives, inspiring others to follow suit in their own capacity and contribute to the collective effort of waste management and reduction.
	</p>
	<p>
		Every week, I make it a point to sift through my belongings and select nine unique items that are no longer of use to me and are ready to be discarded in one way or another. By no means is this a random selection. I carefully choose the items that are the most intriguing or have the most fascinating stories to tell. For each item I pick, I take the time to delve into its history, recounting its story from the moment it came into my possession. I reflect on its purpose, how I used it, and how it has served me. I also contemplate its origins and where it may travel in the following chapters of its existence.
	</p>
	<p>
		In essence, <em>Trash of the Week</em> is not merely a project; it's a statement, a pledge to take responsibility for one's actions and environmental repercussions. It's an invitation for everyone to pause and take a moment to consider the life cycle of the objects we use and dispose of and to make more conscious decisions in our consumption habits. Ultimately, it's a step towards a more sustainable future, where waste is not just an inevitable byproduct of our existence but a resource that can be managed and utilized effectively.
	</p>
	<p>
		The documentation journey is a mindfulness practice that has helped me reduce my waste through more actively conscious awareness. Moreover, my contributions to the <em>Trash of the Week</em> project have furthered my appreciation for the value and usefulness of the things I own and the journey they've taken to get to me. We can collectively reduce the volume of items that inevitably end up in our planet's overflowing landfills. This collective effort encompasses the implementation of practices such as consciously acknowledging what we discard, giving thought to the items we decide to throw away, and considering how we dispose of these items. To reiterate, <em>Trash of the Week</em> is a segment of my weekly routine dedicated to this noble goal.

	<h2 id="conclu">Conclusion</h2>
	<p>
		To maximize the impact of this project and push the boundaries of its potential, I have taken the initiative to dive extensively into the vast ocean of literature on trash and all its various monikers. This deep engagement involves the thorough analysis of a myriad of different initiatives related to trash, a topic of increasing importance in our modern world. These initiatives are diverse, ranging from academically rigorous research conducted by leading experts in environmentalism to innovative think-pieces that reframe our perceptions of trash through an archeological lens. My research also encompasses similar projects found online, all dedicated to the noble cause of waste reduction and effective waste management. By immersing myself in this plethora of knowledge and information, I am enriching my understanding and perspective and seeking to bridge a critical gap. This gap exists between the actions of individuals like you and me and the broader collective of human society, which systematically undermines the efforts rendered to address the imperative issue of waste. My ultimate aim is to connect these personal actions with the more significant collective movements, thereby contributing to the global endeavor to tackle waste in a meaningful and impactful way.
